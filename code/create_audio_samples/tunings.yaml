# Harmonica Tuning Layouts
# -------------------------
# This file defines the note layout for different harmonica tunings.
# All numerical values represent a 'semitone offset' from the harmonica's root key.
# A semitone is the smallest interval in Western music (e.g., from C to C#).
#
# Example on a C Harmonica:
#   - A value of 0  = C (the root note)
#   - A value of 2  = D (2 semitones above C)
#   - A value of 12 = C (12 semitones, or one full octave, higher)

tunings:
  # Richter Tuning is the standard, most common layout for 10-hole diatonic harmonicas.
  # Note currently the software can not handle overblows and overdraws.
  richter:
    # The keys '1' through '10' represent the physical holes on the harmonica.
    1:
      blow: 0      # The blow note is the root note of the key.
      draw: 2      # The draw note is 2 semitones above the root.
      bends: [-1]  # A single draw bend is possible, 1 semitone flat from the natural draw note (value 2).
    2:
      blow: 4
      draw: 7
      bends: [-1, -2] # Two draw bends are possible on this hole (a half step and a whole step flat).
    3:
      blow: 7
      draw: 11
      # The 3-hole draw has three possible bends, each a semitone lower than the last.
      bends: [-1, -2, -3]
    4:
      blow: 12     # The root note, one octave up from hole 1 blow.
      draw: 14
      bends: [-1]
    5:
      blow: 16
      draw: 18
      # No natural bends are possible on hole 5 in Richter tuning.
    6:
      blow: 19
      draw: 21
      bends: [-1]
    7:
      blow: 24     # The root note, two octaves up.
      draw: 23     # NOTE: In the high register (holes 7-10), the draw note is lower than the blow note.
    8:
      blow: 28
      draw: 26
    9:
      blow: 31
      draw: 30
    10:
      blow: 36     # The root note, three octaves up.
      draw: 35
